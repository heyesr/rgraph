    <h1>An adjustable black Meter chart</h1>
    
    <canvas id="cvs" width="300" height="300" style="background-color: black; border-radius: 15px; box-shadow:3px 3px 3px gray; float: right">[No canvas support]</canvas>
    
    <p>
        This Meter chart has been significantly customised which is why it
        looks very different to the default Meter. The start
        and end angles have
        been adjusted as well as the radius of the black part in the center
        having been increased. Before drawing the canvas is cleared to a black color. And the
        Meter is adjustable by way of some custom code that utilises the
        <code>grow()</code> effect. This type of adjusting is custom - the default adjusting
        feature in RGraph is not animated.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Whilst this chart shows you an example of using the
        <code>angleStart</code> and
        <code>angleEnd</code> property you can use
        these properties to significantly change the look of the Meter chart and
        have one that is sideways oriented and not vertically oriented. It depends on the
        interface and aesthetics that you want for how you orient the Meter.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The custom code that facilitates the adjusting just consists of an event
        listener added to the canvas tag, the
        <code>getValue()</code> function to get
        the new value based on the click and then the
        <code>grow()</code> effect that moves
        the pointer to the new position.

        // Create the Meter chart - it must be assigned to a variable in
        // this case so that that variable can be used later.
        meter = new RGraph.Meter({
            id: 'cvs',
            min: 0,
            max: 100,
            value: 75,
            options: {

                // There's various configuration options here so that the Meter looks
                // quite different to the default.
                backgroundColor: 'black',
                anglesStart: RGraph.PI - 0.55,
                anglesEnd: RGraph.TWOPI + 0.5,
                centery: 150,
                textSize: 14,
                textColor: 'white',
                textValign: 'center',
                colorsGreenColor: '#0a0',
                segmentsRadiusStart: 95,
                border: 0,

                centerpinFill: '#ddd'
            }
        }).draw();

        // Now add a click event listener so that when the canvas is clicked on
        // the Meter chart needle animates to show the new value.
        meter.canvas.onclick = function (e)
        {
            var newvalue = meter.getValue(e);
            
            meter.value = newvalue;
            meter.grow();
        }

    This goes in the documents header:
    <pre class="code">
&lt;script src="RGraph.common.core.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="RGraph.common.dynamic.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="RGraph.meter.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
    
    Put this where you want the chart to show up:
    <pre class="code">
&lt;canvas id="cvs" width="600" height="500" style="background-color: black; border-radius: 15px; box-shadow:3px 3px 3px gray"&gt;
    [No canvas support]
&lt;/canvas&gt;
</pre>

    This is the code that generates the chart:
    <div id="dynamic-source-code"></div>
    <script>showSource()</script>
