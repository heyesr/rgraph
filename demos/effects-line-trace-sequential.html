    <h1>A sequential trace effect</h1>
    
    <canvas id="cvs" width="600" height="250" style="background-color: black; float: right">[No canvas support]</canvas>
    
    <p>
        This demo shows you how you can create new effects with a little customisation
        and a smattering of standard JavaScript.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        There are three Line chart objects and each one uses the
        <code>trace()</code> effect - however, the
        second is delayed until the first is finished. And then the third, again using
        the <code>trace()</code> effect, is delayed until the second is finished.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Each Line object is passed all three datasets, however in each chart, two of the
        datasets are set to use <code>transparent</code> as the color - so only one dataset can be
        seen. In the first Line chart it's the first dataset, in the second Line chart it's the
        second and in the third Line chart it's the third dataset.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The visible colors are gradients, as you can see. If it runs a
        little too slow for you on your device (on less powerful devices it
        can slow down a little) you can make the gradients solid colors and you
        can also make the sequential tracing a little delayed - so each dataset starts tracing only
        when the previous has finished and then a little delay too. There's a demo of the datasets
        tracing from the center outwards that you can see here:
        <a href="https://www.rgraph.net/demos/effects-line-tracecenter.html">
            https://www.rgraph.net/demos/effects-line-tracecenter.html
        </a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        That demo also uses the <code>animationTraceCenter</code>
        option - and this changes the <code>trace()</code> effect from tracing from the left-hand side to
        tracing from the center of the chart outwards in both directions.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        When the screen size is smaller the chart shrinks and the CSS <code>float</code> setting
        is removed. Because gradients are used as the fill colors these too are reset.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This is done by having each object clone its original colors so that the gradients are recreated and
        then redrawing the charts.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It should also be noted that the responsive functionality isn't added until all of the animation effects
        have completed. This is done by simply using the standard <code>setTimout()</code> function.
    </p>

    This goes in the documents header:
    <pre class="code">
&lt;script src="RGraph.common.core.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="RGraph.line.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
    
    Put this where you want the chart to show up:
    <pre class="code">
&lt;canvas id="cvs" width="700" height="300"&gt;
    [No canvas support]
&lt;/canvas&gt;
</pre>

This is the code that generates the chart - it should be placed AFTER the canvas tag(s):
    <div id="dynamic-source-code"></div>
    <script>showSource()</script>
