    <h1>A spline range Line chart</h1>
    
    <canvas id="cvs" width="600" height="250" style="float: left" >[No canvas support]</canvas>
    
    <p>
        This range chart is a little different from the others because the datasets
        are organised a little differently. The first dataset
        that you give to the Line chart becomes the bottom dataset and is an
        absolute set of values - in the example here the first
        number is 4.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The second dataset, which is the top line, is additive/accumulative. In this
        case the first point of the second dataset is 1. So when it's
        added to the first point of the first dataset (which was 4) you get a total
        of 5 - which is the figure that is shown on the
        chart.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The reason for this is because the spline range chart is really a stacked
        spline chart - but with the bottom dataset using
        transparent as its color - so you can't see it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This is shown below by gradually changing the color of the bottom dataset
        from blue to transparent.

    <script>
        opacity = 1;
       
        line = new RGraph.Line({
            id: 'cvs',
            data: [
                [4,6,16,15,13,14,18,15,18,16],
                [1,1,1,2,3,5,9,9,6,3]
            ],
            options: {
                spline: true,
                filled: true,
                colors: ['red'],
                shadow: false,
                filledColors: ['rgba(0,0,255,1)','#fdd'],
                xaxisLabels: ['a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i','j'],
                xaxisTickmarksCount: 9,
                tickmarksStyle: null,
                marginBottom: 35,
                textSize:14,
                backgroundGridVlines: false,
                backgroundGridBorder: false,
                xaxis: false
            }
        }).draw();

        for (var i=100; i>=0; i-=1) {
            (function (idx)
            {
                var opacity = i * 0.01;

                setTimeout(function () {
                    line.set('filledColors', ['rgba(0,0,255,' + opacity + ')','#fdd']);
                    RGraph.redraw();
                }, (100 - idx) * 20);
            })(i);
        }
    </script>







    <p></p>

    This goes in the documents header:
    <pre class="code">
&lt;script src="RGraph.common.core.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="RGraph.line.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
    
    Put this where you want the chart to show up:
    <pre class="code">
&lt;canvas id="cvs" width="600" height="250"&gt;
    [No canvas support]
&lt;/canvas&gt;
</pre>

This is the code that generates the chart - it should be placed AFTER the canvas tag(s):
    <div id="dynamic-source-code"></div>
    <script>showSource()</script>

</body>
