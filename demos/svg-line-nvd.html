    <h1>A floating Line chart</h1>

    <RGRAPH_BASIC_DEMO_HTML>
    <div style="width: 600px; height: 250px;float: right" id="chart-container"></div>
    </RGRAPH_BASIC_DEMO_HTML>

    <p>
        This is a demo of a Line chart that was inspired by an example that was
        showcased on the NVD website.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It's a filled Line chart that has the
        <code>filledAccumulative</code> and the <code>spline</code> options enabled.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        And importantly, the first color for the chart is transparent - making it seem
        like the rest of the datasets are "floating".
    
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The rest of the configuration
        is quite straightforward - the vertical grid lines are turned  off and the
        colors are a custom set. There are also labels specified (the labels are numbers
        - though this does NOT make it a scale. The Line chart X-axis is NOT scaled).
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The responsive configuration reduces the size of the SVG tag and removes the CSS <code>float</code>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Note:</b>
        There's a canvas version of this chart in the download (called <i>demos/line-nvd.html</i>) where
        the datasets are traced sequentially (so the datasets are traced one at a time and when one
        dataset finishes tracing the next starts).
    </p>

            {maxWidth:null,width:600,height:250,css:{'float':'right'}},
            {maxWidth:800, width:450,height:200,css:{'float':'none'}}

    This goes in the documents header:
    <pre class="code">
&lt;script src="../libraries/RGraph.svg.common.core.js" &gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="../libraries/RGraph.svg.line.js" &gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
    
    Put this where you want the chart to show up:
    <pre class="code">
&lt;div style="width: 950px; height: 250px" id="chart-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

This is the code that generates the chart - it should be placed AFTER the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag:
    <div id="dynamic-source-code"></div>
    <script>showSource()</script>
