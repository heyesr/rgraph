    This goes in the documents header:
    <pre class="code">
&lt;script src="RGraph.common.core.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="RGraph.common.dynamic.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="RGraph.common.tooltips.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="RGraph.bipolar.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
    
    Put this where you want the chart to show up:
    <pre class="code">
&lt;canvas id="cvs" width="800" height="1000"&gt;
    [No canvas support]
&lt;/canvas&gt;
</pre>

This is the code that generates the chart - it should be placed AFTER the canvas tag(s):
    <div id="dynamic-source-code"></div>
    <script>showSource()</script>
