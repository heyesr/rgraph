    <h1>A dark and graduated blue Bar chart</h1>
    
    <RGRAPH_BASIC_DEMO_HTML>

    <p>
        A dark and graduated Bar chart. The colors are black at the bottom of the
        bars graduating to blue towards the top. The background grid is customised
        too with the horizontal grid lines having been disabled. Nor are there any
        labels. It uses the <code>responsive()</code> function to enable it to
        reduce in size on smaller screens.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Another thing to note here is the complete lack of any labels.
        You don't always need to have labels on your charts, as the meaning may be
        clear without them - perhaps having a title elsewhere on the page. I
        wouldn't imagine that these use-cases are very common though - with most cases
        requiring at least a scale to make sense.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        When the screen is smaller, not much happens - there's no text to reduce in size so the only
        thing that's done is the CSS <code>float</code> is removed and the <code>marginInner</code>
        is tweaked.
    </p>

    
    


    <script id="rgraph-demo-source-code">
        // This is not a complicated configuration - here the data is
        // separated out to its own variable.
        data = [6,4,5,5,7,4,8];
    
        // There's no labels or scale on this chart - 99% of the time
        // you do want at least a scale on your chart but sometimes
        // you will be able to omit it. Other than that, an RGraph
        // gradient is being used and there's no horizontal
        // background bars.
        bar = new RGraph.SVG.Bar({
            id: 'chart-container',
            data: data,
            options: {
                xaxis: false,
                yaxis: false,
                yaxisLabels: false,
                backgroundGridColor: '#999',
                backgroundGridHlines: false,
                backgroundGridBorder: false,
                colors: ['Gradient(#6969FF:#6969FF:#000)']
            }
        // Draw the chart and add some responsive capabilities
        }).draw().responsive([
            {maxWidth: null,width:600, height: 300,options: {marginInner:15},css:{'float':'right'}},
            {maxWidth: 800, width:400, height: 200,options: {marginInner:10},css:{'float':'none'}}

    This goes in the documents header:
    <pre class="code">
&lt;script src="RGraph.svg.common.core.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="RGraph.svg.bar.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
    
    Put this where you want the graphic to show up:
    <pre class="code">
&lt;div style="width: 600px; height: 300px" id="chart-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

This is the code that generates the chart - it should be placed AFTER the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag:
    <div id="dynamic-source-code"></div>
    <script>showSource()</script>
