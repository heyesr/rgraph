    <h1>A Line chart using the animation option</h1>

    <canvas id="cvs" width="600" height="250" style="float: right">[No canvas support]</canvas>
    
    <p>
        This is a canvas  based demonstration of the Line chart <code>animationTraceCenter</code> option
        which is used when utilising the <code>trace()</code> effect.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In addition to this <code>trace()</code> effect, there are three datasets shown - and each one is
        its own chart object.
        The second and third charts start animating when the previous chart has finished.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        ie When the first Line chart finishes its <code>trace()</code> effect the callback triggers the
        second chart to start animating and then when it also finishes animating the third Line chart is
        animated.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The overall effect is as you see here - each dataset animating sequentially. This is better than delayed
        effects (so the second Line chart starts tracing whilst the first is still animating and similarly
        for the third dataset) because the browser isn't animating two charts at once - thus reducing the
        amount of work that it has to do.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In terms of other configuration, the <code>linewidth</code> option is set to zero, the
        <code>backgroundGrid</code> and the <code>axes</code> options are set to false (on two
        of the chart objects),
        the colors are set to gradients and the Y-axis scale maximum is set to 35.
        The labels are added to the first chart that's drawn
    </p>
    
    <p>
        When the screen shrinks the chart is made to be smaller to accommodate the smaller screen
        and the text size is reduced. The CSS <code>float</code> setting of the canvas tag is removed so
        that it isn't aligned to the right-hand side.
    </p>

    This goes in the documents header:
    <pre class="code">
&lt;script src="RGraph.common.core.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="RGraph.line.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

    Put this where you want the chart to show up:
    <pre class="code">
&lt;canvas id="cvs" width="700" height="300"&gt;
    [No canvas support]
&lt;/canvas&gt;
</pre>

This is the code that generates the chart - it should be placed AFTER the canvas tag(s):
    <div id="dynamic-source-code"></div>
    <script>showSource()</script>
