    <h1>A Horseshoe chart</h1>

    <canvas id="cvs" width="300" height="300" style="float: right">[No canvas support]</canvas>
    
    <p>
        As mentioned above, this was previously a variant of the Pie chart. Now, however,
        it has been converted to a full chart type - the <code>Horseshoe</code> meter.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It's a small, circular meter-type chart type. In previous incarnations a large amount of code
        was necessary to create this chart - then less so as a Pie chart variant and now there's similarly
        only a small amount of code that's necessary to create it. As a full chart type it also supports a
        better style of the <code>grow</code> effect - so now if the meter is already showing a value and you
        set a new one and <code>grow</code> to it - instead of always growing from the minimum value the
        meter will <code>grow</code> from its current value. This is shown in the example here.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The chart is a simple circular meter that has a circle at either end. These circles can be disabled
        if you wish. The colors of the chart and the label can also be changed.
    </p>
    
    <script id="rgraph-demo-source-code">
        horseshoe = new RGraph.Horseshoe({
            id: 'cvs',
            min: 0,
            max: 100,
            value: 65,
            options: {
                labelUnitsPost: '%'
            }
        }).grow();
        
        update = function ()
        {
            horseshoe.value = horseshoe.value + RGraph.random(-20,20);
            horseshoe.grow();
            
            setTimeout(update, 2000);
        };

        setTimeout(update, 2000);
    </script>





    <p></p>

    This goes in the documents header:
    <pre class="code">
&lt;script src="RGraph.common.core.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="RGraph.horseshoe.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
    
    Put this where you want the chart to show up:
    <pre class="code">
&lt;canvas id="cvs" width="300" height="300"&gt;[No canvas support]&lt;/canvas&gt;
</pre>

This is the code that generates the chart - it should be placed AFTER the canvas tag(s):
    <div id="dynamic-source-code"></div>
    <script>showSource()</script>
